# Deploying-SNORT-and-PulledPork-on-CentOS-7


## Objective

The objective of this project is to successfully deploy and configure SNORT, a widely-used open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), on CentOS 7, and integrate it with PulledPork for automated rule management and updates. This involves setting up a robust IDS environment capable of monitoring network traffic for potential threats, detecting suspicious activities, and leveraging rule sets to enhance security. By completing this project, the goal is to gain hands-on experience with SNORT's configuration, understand how it functions as a core security tool, and utilize PulledPork to streamline the process of updating and managing SNORT rules efficiently. This ensures a practical understanding of implementing IDS solutions in real-world scenarios while addressing challenges such as rule integration, logging, and system optimization.

### Skills Learned

- SNORT Configuration: Set up and customize an open-source IDS for real-time threat detection.
- PulledPork Integration: Automate rule updates and manage SNORT rule sets efficiently.
- Network Traffic Analysis: Monitor and analyze packets for suspicious activity.
- Intrusion Detection Deployment: Implement an IDS in a Linux environment.
- CentOS Administration: Perform system updates, dependency installation, and configuration on CentOS 7.
- Rule Management: Create, test, and troubleshoot custom detection rules.
- Logging and Alerts: Configure logs for threat visibility and response.
- System Optimization: Enhance IDS performance with resource management and configuration tweaks.

### Tools Used


- SNORT: Open-source intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS).
- PulledPork: Rule management and update tool for SNORT.
- CentOS 7: Linux-based operating system for deploying the IDS.
- YUM/DNF: Package managers for installing dependencies.
- tcpdump: Command-line tool for capturing and analyzing network packets.
- vi/nano: Text editors for modifying configuration files.
- wget/curl: Tools for downloading files and dependencies.
- Firewall (iptables/Firewalld): Configured to manage traffic to/from SNORT.
- Log Management Tools (e.g., syslog): For monitoring SNORT logs.
